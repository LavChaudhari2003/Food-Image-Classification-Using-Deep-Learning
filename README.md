# Food Image Classification Using Deep Learning

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques for food image classification using the Food-101 dataset. The primary goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model to classify food images into 101 distinct categories.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Food-101
- **Content**: 101 food categories with diverse images
- **Preprocessing**: Quality and consistency are ensured through meticulous preprocessing, including data augmentation and normalization.

## Models Implemented
1. **EfficientNetB0**
2. **ResNet50**
3. **InceptionV3**

## Key Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraged for improved feature extraction and performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced model generalization and robustness.

## Evaluation
- Models were evaluated on the test set using accuracy and other metrics.
- Results were visualized to identify the best-performing model.

## Applications
- Automated food recognition systems for restaurants and other food industry solutions.
